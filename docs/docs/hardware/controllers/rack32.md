<!-- Board Description -->
A general purpose control board for rack mount projects.

DIY rack-mount projects often require an Ethernet connection, a status display, power regulation, and other features that are not specific to the project.

This board fits into a rack-mount case and provides those common features so they don't have to be recreated every time.

- **10/100Mbps** Ethernet.
- Support for both DIY (12V) PoE and **802.3af PoE**.
- Pluggable terminal block for optional external DC power input.
- Automotive-grade voltage regulator for harsh electrical environments.
- 6-way IDC "I2C-Breakout" header for linking to other boards.
- 8-way IDC "SPI-LCD" header for connection to an LCD.
- **USB-C** connector for loading firmware.
- Auto power source selection between USB-C, PoE, and external DC.
- I/O header with power, 2 x I2C ports, and second hardware serial port.
- Micro SD card slot for config files, logs, and media storage.
- Onboard **temperature sensor**.
